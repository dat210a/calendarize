## How to run application


- Make sure [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/) or newer is installed.
- Install [Requirements](requirements.txt).
    - For better compatibility, install the official [MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/).
- Ensure you have a database running the [latest schema](../db/c_db_norm.sql).
    - Note: the documentation found in the [db README](../db/README.md) is not current...
- If no configuration files exist, the [cfg README](cfg/README.md) contains blueprints.
- Run the application.
