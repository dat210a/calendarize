#### Guidelines
The python code for this project loosely follows [PEP 8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  
Some IDEs/editors come with PEP8 linting by default, but there should be linting packages for most of the common editors.  

It is not crucial to follow every rule to the letter; i.e. the "shadows from outer scope" guideline is often worth breaking to make code more readable.  
Whether or not breaking this makes your code more or less readable is up to personal judgement, however.

Refactoring code to conform with the guidelines after the fact is easy (and will be done once the code is deemed complete), so not following them isn't going to ruin things, but it's recommended that you try and follow the guidelines from the beginning.
